The second challenge builds on the first. Here the goal is to plot a __direct__ path through the maze from beginning to end. Not plotting any of the deadends. Your solver may well go _down_ these deadends in the course of solving the maze, but in the end you want to only plot the direct path. Due to the algorithm used to create these mazes, this should also be akin to the shortest path from beginning to end.
