The first challenges are all about finding your way through randomly generated mazes of different sizes. In particular, this first challenge will just require you to be able to be able to plot a path from the beginning of the maze to the end of the maze without crossing any walls (and not traveling outside the maze). Any number of dead-end paths can be included, you just must have a legal continuous path from the start of the maze to the end.
