The third challenge builds on the first two.
An extra function has been added to the `MazeGen` library which will generate a maze in which there are multiple possible paths to the exit.
Make sure you re-download it or grab the latest version!
Once imported as usual, you can use it simply by calling `gen_maze2( desired_size )`.
In this challenge your goal is to plot the __shortest__ path through the maze from beginning to end.
Make sure you generate your maze using `gen_maze2`, as there is always only a single path through mazes generated by `gen_maze`!

Once you have a script that can find and plot the shortest path, test it on several different sizes of maze (20, 50, 100) and then send it my way!
